## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is a **Disease Prediction Toolkit** that uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of disease (e.g., heart disease) from healthcare datasets.  

It demonstrates the **end-to-end ML pipeline**:  
✔ Data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, scaling)  
✔ Model training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)  
✔ Model evaluation with metrics and visualizations  
✔ Test cases for reproducibility  
✔ Professional repo setup for portfolio use  

This project is built as part of the **Save Lives with AI Bootcamp**.

## 🎯 Objectives & Learning Outcomes  
- Learn ML fundamentals applied to healthcare datasets  
- Build, train, and optimize supervised ML models  
- Evaluate models with **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC**  
- Visualize results with **confusion matrices & ROC curves**  
- Practice writing clean, reproducible, professional code for GitHub portfolios
